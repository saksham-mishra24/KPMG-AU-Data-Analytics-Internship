# Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment

## Overview

Welcome to Task 1 of the KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation. In this task, you will focus on assessing the data quality and completeness of the datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. Your objective is to identify data quality issues and recommend strategies to mitigate these issues, setting the stage for subsequent data analysis.

## Background

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized organization specializing in bikes and cycling accessories, has sought assistance from KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team. They are eager to harness KPMG's analytics expertise to enhance their business operations. Specifically, they require assistance with their customer and transaction data.

The client has entrusted KPMG with three essential datasets:

1. **Customer Demographic**
2. **Customer Addresses**
3. **Transactions Data (Last 3 Months)**

## Task Description

Upon receiving these datasets, your primary responsibility is to evaluate their data quality and prepare them for in-depth analysis. Additionally, you should pinpoint any assumptions or issues that might have implications for the analysis process. To address these concerns effectively, you will provide recommendations to enhance the current data quality.

## Manager's Instructions

Your manager has provided you with clear instructions via email and voicemail, guiding your approach to this task. These instructions involve reviewing data quality, drafting an informative email to the client, and referring to a Data Quality Framework Table for comprehensive evaluation.

Please review the instructions carefully to align your efforts with the team's expectations.

### Your Task

Your central task is to craft an email to the client that highlights the data quality issues you've identified and outlines actionable strategies to address these issues. Ensure that you refer to the 'Data Quality Framework Table' and any other available resources to comprehensively assess the dataset's quality.

Feel free to provide specific details, recommendations, and insights to aid the client's understanding of the data's current state and the proposed path forward.
