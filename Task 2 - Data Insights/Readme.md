# Task 2 - Data Insights

## Overview

Welcome to Task 2 of the KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation. In this task, you will play a critical role in helping Sprocket Central Pty Ltd target high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. Your objective is to unlock actionable insights that will allow the organization to optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing, ultimately improving business performance.

## Background

Before delving into this task, it's essential to have completed Module 1 for context.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has generously provided a list of 1000 potential customers, complete with their demographics and attributes. Notably, these potential customers have no previous transaction history with the organization.

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is confident that, with a comprehensive analysis, this data can yield invaluable insights. These insights will empower the team to refine their marketing strategy by focusing resources on high-value customers, thus enhancing overall business performance.

## Task Description

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a valued and long-standing client of KPMG, specializes in offering high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories. They are determined to boost business by gaining a deeper understanding of customer trends and behavior. Your mission is to utilize the existing three datasets (Customer Demographic, Customer Address, and Transactions) as a labeled dataset to recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to maximize value for the organization.

To accomplish this, you will follow a structured approach with three key phases:

### Phase 1: Data Exploration

In this phase, you will:

- Analyze data distributions to identify patterns.
- Perform feature engineering to create new variables that enhance modeling.
- Execute data transformations to prepare the data for modeling.

### Phase 2: Model Development

In this phase, you will:

- Build predictive models using advanced analytics techniques.
- Thoroughly test and refine these models to ensure their accuracy and effectiveness.

### Phase 3: Interpretation and Reporting

In this phase, you will:

- Interpret the results of your models to extract meaningful insights.
- Prepare a comprehensive report that includes actionable recommendations for the marketing team.

Your detailed approach for completing the analysis, including specific activities for each phase, must be presented in a well-structured PowerPoint presentation. The client has agreed to a 3-week scope, and your presentation will be a critical step in obtaining their sign-off to proceed with the analysis.

### Additional Tips

- Consider transforming raw data fields into calculated fields for modeling purposes. For example, you may convert date of birth (D.O.B) into age or age groups to facilitate analysis.
- Explore the possibility of sourcing external data from reputable sources like the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) or Census to augment your analysis with additional variables that may enhance your modeling efforts.
