# Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation

## Overview

Welcome to Task 3 of the KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation. This task involves presenting your analysis results effectively to the client by creating a dynamic dashboard with interactive visualizations. The ability to convey key insights visually is crucial for ensuring your findings are both informative and engaging.

## Background

Before proceeding with this task, please ensure you have successfully completed Modules 1 and 2 to build the necessary foundation.

The client has expressed satisfaction with the analysis plan, and they eagerly await the presentation of your results. After successfully building the analytical model, the next critical step is to deliver these findings to the client.

Visualizations, particularly interactive dashboards, are a powerful means of highlighting critical insights and conveying complex ideas in a compelling and succinct manner. A mere list of customers or algorithmic results won't suffice; visualizations are key to supporting your analysis effectively.

## Task Description

Your primary task is to develop a visually appealing and informative dashboard for presentation to the client during the upcoming meeting. This dashboard should encompass the following elements:

- Data Summary: Provide a concise summary of the data, highlighting key statistics and trends.
- Analysis Results: Showcase the results of your analysis, emphasizing key findings and actionable insights.
- Interactive Visualizations: Utilize interactive charts, graphs, and visuals to facilitate client engagement and understanding.

While you are limited to a maximum of three dashboard views or tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is highly encouraged. Additionally, ensure that you incorporate the provided client logo appropriately, as this is not a KPMG-branded deliverable.

### Key Considerations

When presenting your findings, keep the following business context questions in mind:

- **Trends Analysis:** What trends emerge from the underlying data? Highlight significant patterns and anomalies.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Identify and visualize customer segments, emphasizing the one with the highest customer value.
- **Marketing and Growth Strategy:** Propose a data-driven marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd based on your findings.
- **External Data:** Explore the potential of additional external datasets that may offer deeper insights into customer preferences and purchasing behaviors.

Your presentation should not only specify which customers from the new 1000-customer list Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's marketing team should target but also provide insights into the broader market segment that the organization should consider reaching out to.

## Resources

To accomplish this task effectively, consider using data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. These tools are well-suited for creating dynamic and interactive dashboards that can enhance the impact of your presentation.
